    <h1>Opening Paragraph</h1>
    <p>Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well. 
    </p>
    <h1>Statement #1</h1>
    <p>Mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the here and now, fully engaged with whatever we’re doing in the moment. Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. There’s no such thing as perfect meditation. Sometimes your focus will wander or you’ll forget to follow your breath. That’s OK. It’s part of the experience. 
    </p>
    <h1>Statement #2</h1>
    <p>What’s most important is to meditate consistently. It’s one of those things where the journey is more important than the destination. There are thousands of studies that have shown mindfulness meditation can positively impact mental and physical health. Whether it’s by reducing stress, improving sleep, increasing focus, or improving relationships, research shows mindfulness works. While the research on mindfulness, especially digital mindfulness programs, is still growing, there is evidence to support the use of mindfulness training for many outcomes.
        Everyone runs into a few bumps when they're first learning to meditate. It’s pretty common. Fortunately, just recognizing and acknowledging an obstacle can often help you overcome difficulty meditating. 
        </p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>Here are 12 common problems that people tend to run into and some advice on how to move past them. Doubt inevitably shows up in our meditation practice. It’s natural. "Am I meditating correctly?" is a common concern, but the real problem only occurs when we buy into that doubt. Don’t forget, no matter what the thoughts are, they’re still just thoughts. And all you need to do is gently return your focus to the breath. Restlessness can manifest in many different ways. It can be a body that just doesn't want to sit still and keeps fidgeting or moving. We may not be able to find that place of quiet ease and comfort. Or it might be a mind that's overly active, that's overly busy, it just doesn't seem to stop chatting away to itself. It's doing everything it can other than simply being present in this moment. When doubt rises in the mind, it's really tempting to buy into those thoughts. For some reason, those thoughts sound a little more important, a little more believable than the other thoughts. And like any other thoughts, the aim here, the intention is to step back and have a little bit of distance from the thoughts and the feelings. Not to buy into them, not to get swept away by them, not to get overwhelmed by them, but instead to see them clearly and to let them go. Whatever you choose to call it, whether it's worry or anxiety. Whether you characterize it as a tightness in the chest, butterflies in the stomach, or perhaps a headache. Whether the mind is very restless, or stuck on one particular thought or feeling -- worry can change our lives to such an extent that for some people, it's as though there is nothing else in life. When you experience worry within your meditation session, please be reassured that it is very normal. 
    </p>
    <h1>Statement #3</h1>
    <p>Again, worry is just one of many human emotions. We wouldn't want to be without it. It's important. At times it's necessary. It's just when it develops to such an extent, when we become fixated on it in some way, that it begins to overwhelm us or occupy too much of our life, our time, and our attention. Sadness is natural. And it’s not a bad thing. It’s common to shed a few tears and cry while meditating. It can even bring you a sense of relief, having acknowledged something painful and let it go. So if you’re feeling down, that’s okay. Just keep meditating. It's really important to say at the beginning, planning is not a bad thing. We need to be able to plan. If we didn't plan, our lives would be chaos, the world would be chaos. So, it's not that all thinking and all planning is bad, absolutely not. It's just recognizing the planning that is productive and helpful, and the planning that is unproductive, unhelpful and at times, perhaps even unhealthy. </p>
    <h1>Conclussion Paragrpahs</h1>
    <p>In planning so incessantly, we're not really even planning in a very constructive way. It's not even a way we can really engage with; it's just an idea of the future that we're playing over and over in our minds. When you see that tendency, and within the framework of the exercise, it doesn't matter whether it is productive or unproductive -- within the meditation exercise, when you see the mind going in that direction, we let it go and we come back to the focus.
